//! Input focus / modal context (`viewer-input-focus-contexts`): who receives
//! input each frame — the world, a UI widget, or a text field — and who holds
//! the mouse cursor.
//!
//! Folded in alongside [`crate::ui`]'s widget scaffold rather than left to its
//! own change, because the two are one foundation: the scaffold is what makes
//! focus reachable, and without this a focused text field is unusable — every
//! keystroke typed into it *also* drives the avatar, since the whole viewer
//! reads `ButtonInput<KeyCode>` directly and no one had told it not to.
//!
//! # The rule
//!
//! **While anything in the UI holds focus, the world does not get the
//! keyboard** — except the `F`-key overlay toggles, which no text field could
//! want.
//!
//! This is the reference viewer's rule, and it is worth stating precisely
//! because the obvious weaker version is wrong. Firestorm's
//! `LLViewerWindow::handleKey` gives a keystroke to the focused control when
//! there *is* keyboard focus, the key is not an accelerator (`Ctrl` / `Alt`),
//! and it is "likely to generate a character" (`key < 0x80`) — only then does it
//! fall through to `LLViewerInput`'s binding table and thus to the world. Note
//! what that covers beyond the letters: **the arrow keys**, which in a text
//! field move the caret and in the world turn the avatar. Both of ours did both
//! at once.
//!
//! We apply the rule at the system level, with [`world_has_keyboard`] as a run
//! condition on every system that reads a key the UI could want, rather than by
//! filtering keys — Bevy's `ButtonInput` is a shared resource that a system
//! either consults or does not, so the gate belongs at the system.
//!
//! # Contexts
//!
//! [`InputContext`] is derived from `bevy_input_focus`'s `InputFocus` each
//! frame, never set by hand: focus *is* the state, and a second copy of it would
//! only drift. The three cases follow the reference's `acceptsTextInput()`
//! split, and are what a per-context binding profile
//! (`viewer-input-action-map`) will key off.
//!
//! Firestorm's own `keys.xml` **modes** (`MODE_FIRST_PERSON`,
//! `MODE_THIRD_PERSON`, `MODE_EDIT_AVATAR`, `MODE_SITTING` —
//! `indra/newview/llviewerinput.h`) are the *other* axis of that task: they
//! scope what a key does when the world does have the keyboard. They are
//! deliberately not modelled yet — mouselook (`viewer-camera-mouselook`) and the
//! sit/stand actions (`viewer-sit-stand-actions`) are the tasks that would give
//! them a second value to take, and an enum with one inhabitant is not a state
//! machine. [`InputContext::World`] is the seam they extend at.
//!
//! # The cursor
//!
//! The viewer grabbed the cursor unconditionally, which is why UI mouse
//! interaction was impossible: a locked pointer cannot be moved onto a button.
//! [`drive_cursor_grab`] makes the grab follow the context — the world takes it,
//! the UI releases it — so tabbing into a panel frees the mouse, and `Escape`
//! (never a letter key, which a text field would rightly eat) hands it back.
//!
//! **This is a waypoint, not the destination.** Second Life grabs the cursor in
//! **mouselook and nowhere else**: in third person the pointer is free and you
//! click the world with it, and the camera orbits on a modifier-drag rather than
//! on raw motion. So the grab properly keys off the **camera mode**, not off
//! this context at all. The reason [`InputContext::World`] takes the cursor
//! today is that the only camera we have is the debug fly-camera
//! ([`crate::camera`]), which is permanently mouselook-shaped — it steers from
//! raw mouse motion and so cannot work with a free pointer.
//!
//! When [`InputContext::World`] gains the camera modes it is a seam for
//! (`viewer-camera-mouselook`, `viewer-camera-third-person-orbit`), the
//! condition below becomes "the camera is in mouselook" and third person joins
//! the UI on the free-cursor side. At that point `crate::hud_pick`'s `H`
//! free-cursor toggle should disappear rather than be ported: it exists only to
//! escape a grab that third person will not have.
//!
//! Reference (Firestorm, read-only): `indra/newview/llviewerwindow.cpp`
//! (`handleKey` / `handleKeyUp` focus routing), `indra/newview/llviewerinput.h`
//! (the mode enum), `indra/llwindow/llkeyboard`, `llagentcamera` (the mouselook
//! transition that takes and releases the pointer).
