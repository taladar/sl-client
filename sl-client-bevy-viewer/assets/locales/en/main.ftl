# The viewer's English (base) string bundle — Project Fluent, loaded through
# `bevy_fluent` by `src/i18n.rs`. Every UI-bearing panel looks its strings up
# here by key rather than embedding an English literal, so a translator can
# ship another locale without the panel changing.
#
# This is the i18n *scaffold*: it carries only the handful of strings the
# scaffold itself needs plus the demonstrations the `F6` panel drives. Panels
# add their own keys as they land.

## Typographic conventions — punctuation the UI inserts itself, which is a
## translator's call, not a hardcoded literal (see the task file).

# The truncation ellipsis the tab widget appends to a clipped label. Latin
# convention is a single horizontal ellipsis; CJK locales override it with a
# centred six-dot form (see `ja`).

# A number argument feeding a plural selector. English has two plural categories
# (`one` / `other`); Fluent chooses the branch from this locale's CLDR rules, so
# the same authoring is correct in a language with more categories (see `pl`,
# `ar`) — unlike the reference viewer's hardcoded three-language if-ladder.
