title: Group profile floater — general / members / roles / notices
topic: viewer
status: ready
origin: split from viewer-social-groups (2026-07-21) — the list shipped, the
  profile is its own task

Context: [context/viewer.md](../context/viewer.md).

The group **profile**: a separate floater (the Vintage skin opens
`FSFloaterGroup` / `panel_group_info_sidetray` rather than embedding it in the
Contacts floater), reached from the [[viewer-social-groups]] list's **Info**
button — which is present-but-inert until this task wires it. Tabs:

- **General** — name, insignia, charter, founder, member / role counts, join
  fee, open enrollment, mature flag; the agent's own membership toggles (receive
  notices / list in profile → `SetGroupAcceptNotices`), active-title combo
  (`UpdateGroupTitle`), and Join.
- **Members & Roles** — the members list (virtualized: name / title /
  contribution / status) and the roles list, the abilities (`group_powers`
  `GP_*`) viewer, and the **mutations**: eject member (`EjectGroupMembers`),
  member↔role assignment (`ChangeGroupRoleMembers`), and role create / delete /
  ability edits (`UpdateGroupRoles`) — all power-gated on the agent's own
  `group_powers`.
- **Notices** — the notice list, viewing a notice's full body
  (`RequestGroupNotice`), and composing / sending one (`SendGroupNotice`,
  gated on `NOTICES_SEND`).

The whole group protocol already exists (Groups V2) and all the commands /
events above are re-exported through `sl-client-bevy`; this task is the panels
that present and mutate the profile. Note `UpdateGroupInfoParams` and
`GroupName` are **not yet** re-exported from `sl-client-bevy` (only
pattern-matchable via the event) — export them if General-tab editing needs to
name the type.

Not in scope here (as in the reference's other tabs): Land / Assets, Money /
accounting, Experiences, Banned Residents, and the group create / search /
invite dialogs.

Reference (Firestorm, read-only): `llpanelgroup`, `llpanelgroupgeneral`,
`llpanelgrouproles`, `llpanelgroupnotices`, `llgroupmgr`, Vintage
`floater_fs_group` / `panel_group_info_sidetray`.

Builds on: [[viewer-social-groups]] (the list + its inert Info button) and the
group model.
